[1mIMPLEMENTATION[0m
       Cray Linux Environment (CLE)

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mcc [22mcommand invokes the C compiler in the currently loaded Programming Environment. The command links in the fundamental header files and libraries provided for applications that run on a Cray system.

       To see which Programming Environment (PrgEnv) is currently loaded, enter:

         > [1mmodule list[0m

       To see which Programming Environments are available on your system, enter:

         > [1mmodule avail PrgEnv[0m

       Cray recommends against calling the PGI, GCC, or Intel C compiler directly to build code intended for compute nodes, login nodes, or service nodes. If you choose to do this, you are responsible for properly constructing the
       link options.

       The [1mcc [22mcommand takes the following parameters:

       -[no-]add-rpath
                 Controls whether or not [1m-Wl,-rpath [22moptions are added for all [1mpkg-config[22m-generated [1m-L [22moptions. This can be useful to lock in specific versions of libraries at runtime for dynamically linked applications.

                 Default: off

       --[no-]as-needed
                 Controls whether or not [1m-l [22moptions provided by the driver will be wrapped with [1mWl,as-needed [22mand [1m-Wl,-no-as-needed [22mwhen possible to minimize unnecessary dependencies when linking dynamically.

                 Default: on

       --[no-]custom-ld-script[=[4mscript[24m]
                 Controls whether or not CrayPE attempts to pass [1mld [22ma custom linker script. If a script is provided, it will be used. Otherwise, a custom script will be used if beneficial.

                 Default: on

       --cray-bypass-pkgconfig
                 Disable linking PE libraries via [1mpkg-config[22m.

       --cray-print-opts[=[4moption[24m]
                 Print the results generated by [1mpkg-config[22m, where [4moption[24m can be:

                 [1mall       [22mPrint all include and library information.

                 [1mcflags    [22mPrint include information.

                 [1mcray_ld_library_path[0m
                           Print a dynamically generated [1mCRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH[0m

                 [1mlibs      [22mPrint library information

                 [1mpcfiles   [22mPrint the pcfiles that [1mpkg-config [22mwill be called with.

                 [1mpkg_config_path[0m
                           Print the [1mPKG_CONFIG_PATH [22mused.

                 [1mvariables [22mPrint the variable definitions that [1mpkg-config [22mwill be called with.

       --craype-append-opt[=[4mflag[24m]
                 Add [4mflag[24m after all CrayPE-generated flags. This can effectively be used to override flags set by CrayPE.

       [4mCray_options[0m
                 Specify one or more options of the Cray C compiler command ([1mcc[22m). For a description of options, see the [1mcraycc(1) [22mman page and the [4mCray[24m [4mC[24m [4mand[24m [4mC++[24m [4mReference[24m [4mManual[24m.

       [4mPGI_options[0m
                 Specify one or more options of the PGI C compiler command ([1mpgcc[22m). For a description of options, see the [1mpgcc(1) [22mman page and the [4mPGI[24m [4mUser's[24m [4mGuide[24m.

                 [1mNote:  [22mCray systems do not support the following PGI Cluster Development Kit (CDK) options ([1m-Mprof=mpi[22m, [1m-Mmpi[22m, and [1m-Mscalapack[22m).

       [4mGCC_options[0m
                 Specify one or more options of the GCC C compiler command ([1mgcc[22m). For a description of available options, see the [1mgcc(1) [22mman page and the [4mUsing[24m [4mthe[24m [4mGNU[24m [4mCompiler[24m [4mCollection[24m.

       [4mIntel_options[0m
                 Specify one or more options of the Intel C compiler command ([1micc[22m). For a description of available options, see the [1micc(1) [22mman page and the [4mIntelÂ®[24m [4mParallel[24m [4mStudio[24m user guide.

       [4mfiles[24m     Specifies the files to be compiled and/or linked.

       [1m-craympich-mt[0m
                 Directs the driver to link in an alternate version of the Cray-MPICH library which provides fine-grained multi-threading support to applications that perform MPI operations within threaded regions. See the
                 [1mintro_mpi(3) [22mman page.

       [1m-craype-verbose[0m
                 Print the command which is forwarded to compiler invocation.

       [1m-dynamic  [22mDirects the compiler driver to link dynamic libraries at runtime, rather than linking static libraries in at compile time. The linker stores the internal name of the dynamic library in the executable file. The
                 actual library that is loaded at runtime must have the same internal name, but may differ from the filename of the library found at link time. This option is used to create dynamically linked executable files and
                 may not be used with the [1m-static [22mor [1m-shared [22moptions.

       [1m-help     [22mDisplay programming environment specific options.

       [1m-shared   [22mCreates a library which may be dynamically linked at runtime.

       [1m-static   [22mDirects the linker to use the static version of the libraries, not the dynamic version of the libraries, to create an executable file.

       [1m-target-cpu=[4m[22mcpu[0m
                 Set CPU target. This setting overrides the default setting defined by the users' module environment. To see which CPU targets are available on your system, enter this command:

                 > [1mmodule avail craype-[0m

       [1m-target-network=[4m[22mnetwork[0m
                 Set network target to either Aries, Gemini, Infiniband, or none. This setting overrides the default setting defined by the users' module environment. To see which network targets are available on your system, enter
                 this command:

                 > [1mmodule avail craype-network[0m

       [1m-target-accel=[4m[22maccelerator[0m
                 Set accelerator target to either a specific GPU or host. This setting overrides the default setting defined by the users' module environment. To see which accelerator targets are available on your system, enter
                 this command:

                 > [1mmodule avail craype-accel[0m

       In addition, the following predefined macros are supported. These macro values are set when the associated [1mcraype [22mmodule is loadedâ€”for example, if [1mcraype-ivybridge [22mis loaded, [1m-D__CRAY_[4m[22mcpu[24m is set to [1m-D__CRAY_IVYBRIDGE[22mâ€”but can
       be overridden by using the [1m-target [22mcommand line arguments listed above.

       [1m-D__CRAY[4m[22msystem[0m
                 Provided based on the network target used. For example, if the [1mcraype-network-aries [22mmodule is loaded, this is set to [1m-D__CRAYXC[22m.

       [1m-D__CRAY_[4m[22mcpu[0m
                 Provided based on the cpu target used. For example, if the [1mcraype-sandybridge [22mmodule is loaded, this is set to [1m-D__CRAY_SANDYBRIDGE[22m.

       [1m-D__CRAY_[4m[22maccelerator[0m
                 Provided based on the accelerator target used. For example if the [1mcraype-accel-nvidia35 [22mmodule is loaded, this is set to [1m-D__CRAY_NVIDIA35[22m.

[1mNOTES[0m
       The C compiler is part of the Cray, PGI, GCC, and Intel compiler suites. Verify that the desired module ([1mPrgEnv-cray[22m, [1mPrgEnv-pgi[22m, [1mPrgEnv-gnu[22m, or [1mPrgEnv-intel[22m) is loaded before attempting to compile.

       CrayPE supports link line generation for the multi-threaded versions of the LibSci library based on the OpenMP option the user specifies with each compiler.
