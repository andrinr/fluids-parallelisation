# README #

This repository was created during the lecture *High Performance Computing* offered by the University of ZÃ¼rich. 

The main branch contains some exercise solutions, while the MPI, OpenMP and Hybrid branches are parralelized versions of the fluid simulation code as well as some speed measurements. Hybrid means it uses a combination of OpenMP and MPI.
